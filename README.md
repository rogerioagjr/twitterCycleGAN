This is the final project of 6.864 - Advanced Natural Language Processing (MIT) by Rogerio A. Guimaraes Jr.

We are using a dataset that contains tweets from the following accounts:

user              number of tweets
@BarackObama      3254
@BernieSanders    2464
@RealDonaldTrump  39957

The dataset contains only information of the content of the tweet and discards all retweets. Therefore, all the text
contains only content written by the user.
